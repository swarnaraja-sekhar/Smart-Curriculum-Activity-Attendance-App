# Smart-Curriculum-Activity-Attendance-App

Many educational institutions still depend on manual attendance systems, which are time-consuming and error-prone. Teachers spend a significant portion of class time marking attendance, reducing valuable instructional hours. Additionally, students often waste free periods with unproductive activities due to a lack of structured guidance. This leads to poor time management and reduced alignment with long-term academic or career goals. There is also a gap in personalized learning support during idle classroom hours. Institutions currently lack tools that integrate daily schedules with individual student planning and automated tracking.

## Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

This issue impacts both administrative efficiency and student development. Automating attendance saves teachers' time and ensures more accurate records. Additionally, providing students with structured personal development activities during free time helps improve productivity, goal clarity, and learning outcomes. Institutions can also gain better insight into student behavior and engagement, allowing for more targeted support.

## Expected Outcomes

• Automatically marks student attendance based on the daily timetable using QR code, Bluetooth/Wi-Fi proximity, or face recognition.
• Displays real-time attendance on a classroom screen.
• Suggests personalized academic tasks during free periods based on the student's interests, strengths, and career goals.
• Generates a daily routine combining class schedule, free time, and long-term personal goals.
